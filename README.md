# passwordFinder
I would use the network of my neighbores. So i got to use the passwords. And want to create Passwords with a setting file to define how many letters and how many special characters and if the letters are small or capital.
As example: 12 letter code with alphabetic character (capital & small) and numbers. This codes will be written in a simple text file.
